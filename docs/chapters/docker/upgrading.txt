Upgrading
=========

Upgrading a Mayan EDMS Docker container is actually a matter of
stopping and deleting the container, downloading the most recent
version of the image and starting a container again. The container
will take care of updating the database structure to the newest
version if necessary.

.. important::

    If upgrading between multiple versions, it is recommended to follow
    a sequential upgrade path rather than attempting to upgrade
    directly to the latest release. Start by upgrading to the latest
    bug version of the previous series before proceeding to the next
    major version.

.. important::

    Do not delete the volume storing the data, only the container.
    Deleting the volume will delete all the document files.


Docker Compose installation
===========================

Upgrade between minor versions
------------------------------

#. Stop and delete the container stack:

   .. important::

     Do not skip this step. If the stack is not taken down, important
     internal upgrades processes like database migrations will not be
     executed.

   .. code-block:: console

     docker compose down

#. Rename the Docker Compose file and keep it for future reference:

   .. code-block:: console

     mv docker-compose.yml docker-compose.yml.bck
     mv .env .env.bck

#. Download the new Docker Compose files:

   .. code-block:: console

     curl https://gitlab.com/mayan-edms/mayan-edms/-/raw/master/docker/docker-compose.yml -O
     curl https://gitlab.com/mayan-edms/mayan-edms/-/raw/master/docker/.env -O

#. Edit and the adjust the new Docker Compose and `.env` files, copying
   over all relevant values like username, password, etc.

#. Pull the new image version:

   .. code-block:: console

     docker compose pull

#. Launch the rest of container stack:

   .. code-block:: console

     docker compose up --detach

   .. note::

     The app container will perform all the necessary migrations to the
     existing data.


Upgrade between major versions
------------------------------

.. note::

  Upgrade between major versions might vary for each version. Consult
  the release note for the specifics of upgrading major versions.
