Docker is a container technology. Containers are a standard unit of software
that packages up code and all its dependencies.

Mayan EDMS uses Docker Compose as its main distribution method.

By default, the entire software stack is deployed as a single container. This
provides an easy way to get started and will be sufficient for several
thousand documents.

For larger installations use a multi container deployment.
